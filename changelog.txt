# CHANGE LOG FOR MULTI-REPORT

# V3.16 (25 February 2025)
#
#  - Change for the FARM check to allow a reasonable difference in Power On Hours, using an exact match can be unreasonable.
#    ---- Using an exact power on hours match apparently may not be true for every valid drive, example: refurbished.
#  - Moved the Seagate FARM Check configuration (-config) settings into the SMR/GPT section.
#  - Updated writing config file for a new statistical data file variable related to Seagate FARM check.
#

# V3.15 (22 February 2025)
#
#  -- Added Seagate Drive SCAM check.
#  -- Updated SMR function to utilize Joe Schmuck hosted SMR script, due to security concerns.
#  -- Removed Parition Check and Backup from CORE due to script security concerns.
#  -- Modified the Alert Email option '-m' to include Warning messages to go along with Critical and Drive High Temp.
#  -- Fixed to allow the -update_all switch to selectivly update each of the three scripts (Multi-Report, Drive_Selftest, or Sendemail.py).
#  -- When adding an unknown drive, added parameter to use 'actual' or 'zero' the drive total read/write throughput, default="actual".
#  -- Updated Variables and Config File to line up with Drive_Selftest Version 1.04.
#

# V3.14 (28 January 2025)
#
# - Added if sendemail.py error message, send full sendem,ail.py error message to the console. (1/27/25)
# - Fixed inadvertant 'gdisk' and 'sgdisk' not installed error messages for CORE.  (1/28/25)
#

# V3.13 (26 January 2025)
#
# - Re-added Multipath which was commented out and not restored.
# - Fixed Spencer operation.
# - Fixed the automatic update feature.
# - Sendemail.py no longer instralled on CORE system (not required).
# - Minor formatting changes.
# - Added NVMe ONLY or All Drive Testing variable for Drive_Selftest script (version 1.03).
# 

# V3.12 (19 January 2025)
#
# Fixed Updating Script, for the most part.  `-update` , `-update_selftest` , and `-updated_sendemail` work.
#

# V3.11 (18 January 2025)
#
# Fixed gdisk and sgdisk installation on CORE, resolving drive errors on LINE 4434 error messages.
#
#
#
# V3.1 Beta 7 (17 January 2025)
#
#   - Removed all S.M.A.R.T. testing from Multi-Report and created companion script Drive-Selftest.
#     ---- Drive-Selftest script provides all the required functionality to run SMART tests on
#     ---- on all the system drives and report any issues.  This is in preparation for when
#     ---- TrueNAS has resolved the NVMe SMART testing issues, then the companion script
#     ---- will no longer be required.  Additionally it simplifies the Multi-Report script.
#   - A Zpool error now flags the suspect drive as well in the text section of the output file.
#   - Replacing switches '-dump emailextra' with '-dump emailall'. Either will function for now.
#   - Added NVMe Temperature Sensors 1 and 2 to the Chart, if they exist.
#   - Fixed sgdisk partition error for drives named 'sdp'.
#   - And a lot of other small tweaks.

# V3.0.8 Beta (Not released to the public)  (18 November 2024)
#
#   - Fix for some NVMe drives may report self-test results with leading white space.
#   - Fix for not checking if NVMe drives exist before attempting to run self-test.
#   - Fix for a drive serial number with white space.
#   - Added more data collection for NVMe drives (NVMe Self-Test Log and NVMe Error-Log).
#   - REMOVED SMART Testing from within Multi-Report and created new seperate companion script for SMART testing called Drive_Selftest.
#   - Added Partition Backups generated and attached when TrueNAS Configuration is attached (by request).
#   - Cleaned up the Text Section and added a little more data.
#   - Added dumping of API drive data to aid in development efforts using the API.
#   - Added automatic update to statistical data file (reformatting the file to fix 30 day Total Data Read/Written issue).
#   - Updated SMR Drive Checking to report drives for 14 runs of the script.
#   - Fix for NVMe errors messages for drive checks on NVMe drive which does not support Self-test.
#   - Added message that if using TrueNAS 24.10 or greater, the Smartmontools Override is no longer "required".  However people may still desire to use it.
#   - Fixed some (null) error messages while collecting smart data from drive.
#   - Added error message for statistical data file not containing a drive serial number.
#   - Added ZFS/Pool ONLINE (green) or if other (red).
#   - Added API data capture routine for -dump routine supporting troubleshooting.
#   - Updated the JSON Error Log to remove some of the un-needed data.
#   - Added option to Enable/Disable running external SMART test script.  Internal testing removed from Multi-Report.
#   - Added checking previous SMART check pass/fail.  This will catch any SMART Long test failures from a previous run.
#   - No longer download all github files, only downloads the files we need.

# V3.0.7 (08 June 2024)
#
#   - Fixed for some NVMe drives may report self-test results with leading white space.
#   - Fixed to actually generate an alarm for Media Errors.
#   - Added Compensation (offset) for Media Errors.
#   - Added more data collection for NVMe drives (NVMe Self-Test Log and NVMe Error-Log).

# V3.0.6 (02 June 2024)
#
#   - (The push for this change) Fix for Zpool gptid listing in text section (listing cache, log, meta, spare, and dedup).
#
#   - Added polling NVMe drives for self-test completion when 'waiting' for test complete.  The default is now to wait for the test(s) to complete.
#     ---- The smart self-test will start on ALL NVMe drive at the same time will be asked if the test completed or failed once a second.
#     ---- When the results are present the script will continue on to each successive NVMe drive, which if they were all identical, the tests
#     ---- should be completing within a second of the first drive polled.  This happens for both Short and Long tests.
#     ---- A new pair of variables in the multi_report_config.txt file can be set to "false" to have the script not wait and just use the previous
#     ---- results.  By default the script will wait.
#     ---- Now for a question to hose who are reading this...  How would yo feel about checking the last test time for each NVMe and if it
#     ---- the last test time was less than 18 hours old, then skip the test.  Of course it will end up being a variable that the user could
#     ---- change the time value.  I just thought of this because when I test, I end up running a lot of NVMe self-tests.
#     ---- Send me joeschmuck2023@hotmail.com an email or just message me on the forum if you have an option.
#
#   - Changed using smartmontool if v7.4 is installed to "enable" as TrueNAS (no version) supports scheduled NVMe self-testing.

# V3.0.5 (25 May 2024)
#
#   -Fix for Zpool Status error messages.
#   -Added SMR drive background in yellow.

# V3.0 (30 March 2024)
#
# Notable issues:
# NVMe - Last SMART Short and Long tests not displaying in text area. It will be solved when Smartmontools 7.4 is installed.
#      -- This is not an issue in SCALE 23.10.2 as it has Smartmontools 7.4.
#

#   - Updated Configuration Questions to make configuration a little easier.
#   - Removed 'Mouseover' option and hardcoded it.

#   - Corrected 'Pool_Capacity_Type' variable missing in config file.
#   - Added checking for all software commands to respond (thanks dak180 for the idea).
#   - Added custom wear level alarm value 'i' to the group 'n' 'r' 'd'. 'i' = Ignore.  This makes wearLevel="", non-exist.
