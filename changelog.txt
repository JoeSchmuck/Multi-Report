#
#   NOTES: If there is an error such as the host aborts a drive test and an error occurs, the script may
#   report a script failure.  I do not desire to account for every possible drive error message.
#   If you take a look at your drive data, you may notice a problem.  Fix the problem and the
#   script should work normally.  If it still does not, then reach out for assistance.
#
#   The multi_report_config file will automatically update previous versions to add new features.
#
# v1.6d-2 (09 October 2022)
#   - Bug fix for NVMe power on hours.
#   --- Unfortunately as the script gets more complex it's very easy to induce a problem.  And since I do not have
#   --- a lot of different hardware, I need the users to contact me and tell me there is an issue so I can fix it.
#   --- It's unfortunate that I've have two bug fixes already but them's the breaks.
#   - Updated to support more drives Min/Max temps and display the non-existent value if nothing is obtained vice "0".
#   
#   The multi_report_config file is compatible with version back to v1.6d.
#
# v1.6d-1 (08 October 2022)
#   - Bug Fix for converting multiple numbers from Octal to Decimal.  The previous process worked "most" of the time
#   -- but we always aim for 100% working.
#   
#   The multi_report_config file is compatible with version back to v1.6d.
#
# v1.6d (05 October 2022)
#   - Thanks goes out to ChrisRJ for offering some great suggestions to enhance and optimize the script.

#   - Added Raw Read Error Rates chart column.
#   - Added compensation for Seagate Seek Error Rates and Raw Read Error Rates.
#   - Added Automatic Configuration File Update feature.
#   - Added selection between ZFS Pool Size or Zpool Pool Size. ZFS is representative of the actual storage capacity
#   -- and updated the Pool Status Report Summary chart.
#   - Added ATA Error Log Silencing (by special request).
#   - Added 0.1 second delay after writing "$logfile" to eliminate intermittent file creation errors.
#   - Fixed Text Report -> Drive Model Number not showing up for some drives.
#   - Added option to email copy of multi_report_config.txt upon any automatic script modification and/or by day.
# v1.6c (28 August 2022)
#   - Supports external configuration file (but not required).
#   - Completely Configurable by running the script -config parameter (this took a lot of work).
#   - Added HDD/SSDmaxtempovrd variables to combat some bogus SSD values.
#   - Added TLER (SCT) support.
#   - Added support for drives which do not support recording over 65536 hours for SMART Tests and rolls over to start at zero again.
#   - Added -dump parameter to create and email all of the drives smartctl outputs as text file email attachments.
#   - Added support for Helium drives.
# v1.6: (05 August 2022)
#   Thanks to Jeff, Simon, and Sean for providing me more test data than I could shake a stick at and friendly constructive opinions/advice.
#   - Complete rewrite of the script.  More organized and easier for future updates.
#   - Almost completely got rid of using AWK, earlier versions had way too much programming within the AWK structure.
#   - Reads the drives much less often (3 times each I believe).
#   - Added test input file to parse txt files of smartctl -a output. This will allow for a single drive entry and ability
#   -- for myself or any script writer to identify additional parameters for unrecognized drives.
#   -- Usage: program_name.sh [HDD|SSD|NVM] [inputfile_a.txt] [inputfile_b.txt]
#   - Added better support for SAS drives.
#   - Fixed NVMe and SAS Power On Hours for statistical data recording, and other things.
#   - Added Critical and Warning Logs to email output with better descriptive data.

#   - Added support for SandForce SSD.
# v1.5:
#   - Added NVMe support
#   - Added clearer error reporting for Warning and Critical errors.
#   - Known Problems: The NVMe Power On Time has a comma that I can't get rid of, yet. I want to remove the comma when the data is retrieved.
#   -- NVMe's are not all standardized so I expect tweaks as different drive data arrives.
#   -- onHours that includes a comma will not record correctly in the statistical data file.  This is related to the NVMe problem above.
#   -- Zpool Summary does not indicate Scrub Age warning, likely the entire summary has issues. 
# v1.4d:
#   - Fixed Scrub In Progress nuisance error when a scrub is in progress.
#   - Added offsetting Reallocated Sectors for four drives.  This should be for testing only. Any drives
#   -- with a significant number of bad sectors should be replaced, just my opinion.
#   - Added Drive Warranty Expiration warning messages and ability to disable the Email Subject line warning.
#   -- NOT TESTED ON OTHER THAN U.S. FORMATTED DATE YYYY-MM-DD.
#   - Added HDD and SSD individual temperature settings.
#   - Changed order of polling Temperature data from HDD/SSD.
# v1.4c:
#   - Rewrite to create functions and enable easier editing.
#   - Added Custom Reports.
#   - Added disabling the RAW 'smartctl -a' data appended to the end of the email.
#   - Added sorting drives alphabetically vice the default the OS reports them.
#   - Added RED warning in Device for any single failure in the summary (deviceRedFlag switch controlled).
#   - Added some additional SSD definitions.
#   - Fixed sorting last two SMART Tests, now reports them in proper order.
#   - Fixed detecting "SMART Support is: Enabled", for white spaces.
#   - Changed IGNORE DRIVES to a String Format to clean up and simplify programming.
#   - Added MultiZone_Errors support for up to eight drives.
#   - Added sectorWarn variable to complement the sectorCrit variable.
#   - Added ignoreSeekError variable to ignore some of those wild Seek Error Rate values.
#   - Added ignoreUDMA CRC Errors due to the "Known Problem"
#   - Fixed md5/sha256 error on TrueNAS Scale (only used during config backups).
#   - Added selectable config backup periodicity by day vice every run.
#   - Added Exporting statistical data for trend analysis.
#   -- Can be setup to email statistics weekly, monthly, or not at all.
#   -- The -s switch will run Data Collection Only, no email generated.  Note: Do Not run two instances at once, the temp files do not survive.
#   - Fixed the Capacity to remove the brackets "[]", thanks Jeff Alperin.
#   - Fixed Scrub Age failure due to 1 day or longer repair time, now shows anything >24 hours.
#
#   - Known Problem: One user reported UDMA_CRC_Errors is not subtracting correctly, have not been able to personally replicate it.
#   -- This error seems to occur around line #1027
# v1.4b:
#   - Added SMART test remaining percentage if Last Test has a SMART Test is in progress.
#   - Fix for empty SMART fields, typically for unsupported SSD's.
#   - Added IGNORE SMART Drive so you can ignore specific drives that may cause you weird readings.
#   --- Updated so blank SSD table header is removed when you ignore all the drives (just crazy talk).

#   - Fixed report errors for if a SCRUB is in progress, now shows estimated completion time.
#   - Fixed report error for a Canceled SCRUB.
#   - Fixed FreeBSD/Linux use for SCRUB report (minor oversight).
# v1.4:
#   - Run on CRON JOB using /path/multi_report_v1.4.sh
#   - Fixed for automatic running between FreeBSD and Linux Debian (aka SCALE) as of this date.
#   - All SMART Devices will report.
#   - Added conditional Subject Line (Good/Critical/Warning).
#   - Added Automatic SSD Support.
#   --- Some updates may need to be made to fit some of SSD's. Code in the area of about line 530 will
#   --- need to be adjusted to add new attributes for the desired SSD's fields.
#   - UDMA_CRC_ERROR Override because once a drive encounters this type of error, it cannot be cleared
#   --- so you can offset it now vice having an alarm condition for old UDMA_CRC_Errors.
#   - Added listing NON-SMART Supported Drives.  Use only if useful to you, some drives will
#   --- still output some relevant data, many will not.
# v1.3:
#   - Added scrub duration column
#   - Fixed for FreeNAS 11.1 (thanks reven!)
#   - Fixed fields parsed out of zpool status

#   - Config backup now attached to report email
#   - Added option to turn off config backup
#   - Added option to save backup configs in a specified directory
#   - Power-on hours in SMART summary table now listed as YY-MM-DD-HH
#   - Changed filename of config backup to exclude timestamp (just uses datestamp now)
#   - Config backup and checksum files now zipped (was just .tar before; now .tar.gz)
#   - Fixed degrees symbol in SMART table (rendered weird for a lot of people); replaced with a *
#   - Added switch to enable or disable SSDs in SMART table (SSD reporting still needs work)
#   - Added most recent Extended & Short SMART tests in drive details section (only listed one before, whichever was more recent)
#   - Reformatted user-definable parameters section
#   - Added more general comments to code
# v1.0:
#   - Initial release
